# SimplestChat
A small TCP chat server&amp;client, tiny bit of exercise in C# and uploading to git. Hoping to write something *cool* and *rad* one day.
I have no idea how licensing works, so if you find this small piece of app useful, feel free to use it in anyway you wish.

Server's IP/Port is hardcoded in Program.cs
